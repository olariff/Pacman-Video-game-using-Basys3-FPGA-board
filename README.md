# Pacman-Video-game-using-Basys3-FPGA-board
This is created using VHDL programming language. The basic layout includes pacman, some pac-dots, and the enemies. The shapes representing these elements are very simple. The sprites are be placed in random positions at the beginning of the game. The four buttons of the Basys3 board is used to move pacman (represented as a yellow circle) within the play area. The purpose of the game is to collect the pac-dots without being
hit by the enemies (coloured squares). For simplicity, each enemy moves at constant speed either in horizontal or vertical direction and can fly over other enemies and pac-dots.
